The Nebraska Cornhuskers are getting closer to hiring the next head coach for a football program that has fallen on hard times .

Matt Rhule, who was fired as head coach of the Carolina Panthers in October, and Nebraska are working on finalizing a deal in the coming days, according to ESPN.

Nebraska fired head coach Scott Frost in September after an embarrassing loss to Georgia Southern.

Under Frost, the Cornhuskers failed to win five games in a season, lost 10 consecutive one-score games and became an afterthought in the Big Ten.

Frost finished his time at his alma mater with a record of 16-31.

Mickey Joseph, a former Nebraska quarterback, took over for Frost on an interim basis after coaching the wide receivers and has gone 2-6 since taking over the program.
