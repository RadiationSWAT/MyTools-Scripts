TOP CFB DFS QUARTERBACKS

Joe Milton - Tennessee @ Vanderbilt ($7.7K DK/$9.5K FD)

The Joe Milton era has been restarted at Tennessee. The former Michigan quarterback started last season before an injury against Pitt gave Hendon Hooker the starting nod. We all know what happened after that. Get this though, Milton has more pass plays of 50+ yards (five) this season than all but three SEC quarterbacks (Hooker, Jaxson Dart, and Will Levis) and 18 FBS QBs and it’s been on only 33 passes. Tennessee still has a New Year’s Six bid to play for on Saturday night against Vanderbilt, a team that has won two straight games, but at $7.7K I will be all over Milton in cash games.

Clayton Tune - Houston @ Tulsa ($8.0K DK)

Cougars quarterback Clayton Tune is the AAC’s leading passer by a wide margin. He peppered East Carolina for 435 yards and four touchdowns in Houston’s 42-3 rout last Saturday. Tune, who is tied for first in the nation with CJ Stroud with 35 touchdowns thrown, has now passed for three or more touchdowns in each of the past six games. The senior does have a tough matchup as Tulsa allows less than 200 passing yards per game (190) but he has been so consistent in the air and on the ground that he is near matchup proof with a high floor and ceiling.

Tyler Shough - Texas Tech vs. Oklahoma ($6.2K DK/$8.6K FD)

It’s the Tyler Shough Show for now as he has grown as a runner in the past couple of weeks and does enough through the air to be successful. He is set to make his fourth start of the year after missing most of the season with a shoulder injury and he is a solid start tonight against a soft Oklahoma defense. Last week against Iowa State he led them to the win after completing 15-of-21 passes for 141 yards and one touchdown plus he had 14 rushes for 33 yards. The Sooners are allowing 228.6 yards in the air and 162.5 yards on the ground and at $6.2K DK, Shough is firmly in play as a value.

Other Quarterbacks To Consider:

John Rhys Plumlee - Central Florida ($7.9K DK/$11.0K FD)

Jayden Daniels - LSU ($8.4K FD/$10.5K FD)

Jacurri Brown - Miami (FL) ($5.2K DK/$6.5K FD)

Will Howard - Kansas State ($6.6K DK/$10.6K DK) DK GPP

Garrett Shrader - Syracuse FD GPP

TOP CFB DFS RUNNING BACKS

Deuce Vaughn - Kansas State vs. Kansas ($7.2K DK/$9.7K FD)

The Wildcats feature one of the best running backs in college football in Vaughn. He’s a versatile back that Steve Sarkisian does a really good job generating creative play calls for him. Not just running the ball but receiving the ball and moving around as Vaughn currently ranks ninth in school history with 1,148 yards plus ranks 14th nationally in scrimmage yards (rushing + receiving) per game at 128.5, while he is 22nd in the country in all-purpose yards per game at 128.55. He also ranks second nationally among running backs with three receiving touchdowns this season, while he is fifth in catches (38), and 14th in receiving yards (266). Vaughn is an easy core play tonight against a Kansas run defense that is allowing 190.5 yards per game on the ground.

Austin Jones - USC vs. Notre Dame ($6.0K DK/$7.6K FD)

With Travis Dye out, Jones ran like he was possessed last week against UCLA. He ran the ball 21 times for 120 yards and two touchdowns last week for a 5.7 yards per carry average picking up right where Dye left off. He now has 455 yards rushing on the year on 6.2 yards per carry and scored his fourth and fifth rushing touchdowns of the season against the Bruins.

RJ Harvey - Central Florida ($5.3K DK/$5.8K FD)

We have the War on I-4 tonight- a big deal down here in Tampa. Redshirt junior Harvey has been a good complementary back for the Knights, racking up 659 yards and four touchdowns this season. USF ranks 128th in the nation in rushing defense, giving up 224.5 yards per game while UCF has the nation's seventh-best rushing offense, averaging 234.5 rushing yards per game. Harvey is running the ball 13.5 times a game over the last four and has four double-digit fantasy points on DraftKings in his last six games. Solid point per dollar play here for Harvey.

Other Running Backs To Consider:

Eric Gray- Oklahoma ($7.4K DK/$9.4K FD) 2nd best RB on slate to Vaughn

Devin Neal - Kansas ($6.3K DK/$7.4K FD)

Sean Tucker - Syracuse ($8.4K FD) Top FD GPP

Ray Davis - Vanderbilt ($6.7K DK/$8.0K FD)

Isiah Bowser - Central Florida ($5.8K DK/$7.8K FD)

Jabari Small - Tennessee ($5.7K DK/$8.6K FD)

Amari Daniels - Texas A&M ($3.6K DK/$4.9K FD) Top Punt

TOP CFB DFS WIDE RECEIVERS

Nathaniel Dell - Houston vs. Tulsa ($7.6K DK)

Tune’s favorite target is Tank Dell, who has 94 receptions for 1,193 yards and 14 touchdowns this season, ranking second in the nation in all three categories. Tonight he will be facing off across the sidelines with Tulsa’s Keylon Stokes, both one of 12 Biletnikoff Award semifinalists, honoring the nation’s top receiver and both stud Alphas of their teams. Dell gets to see the Tulsa defense, which is ranked 22nd in the nation in passing defense (190.0 yards per game) even after allowing USF freshman Byrum Brown completed 21 straight passes for 240 yards and three touchdowns last week. Plus, they have taken a little dive over the last four games allowing 294.3 yards per game over that span. Tank Dell is matchup proof and the top receiver on DraftKings.

Jalin Hyatt and Cedric Tillman - Tennessee @ Vanderbilt ($7.4K & 7.3K DK/$9.8K & 8.0K FD)

As one of the nation’s most productive pass-catchers, Hyatt has made it a habit every single week to slice apart opposing defenses out of the slot. Over his last four games he is averaging 8.5 targets and six receptions to go along with a 100.3 yard per game average and three scores.

After missing four games due to a high ankle sprain, Tillman returned for the Kentucky and Georgia games before missing the Missouri game. Last week at South Carolina Tillman played all 84 snaps and caught nine passes for 81 yards and two touchdowns. In other words, we need to keep an eye on Tillman’s status but when he plays, he’s one of the best wide outs in the game. Hyatt is the DraftKings play while Tillman is the lean on FanDuel with a $1.8K discount from his teammate.

Colbie Young - Miami vs. Pittsburgh ($4.1K DK/$7.0K FD)

Sophomore receiver Young leads all Hurricane receivers with five touchdowns and is second on the team in yards receiving with 376 and third in receptions with 31. Last week against Clemson he led Miami with six targets as he finished with four catches for 25 yards. Value punts at wide receiver will be hard to come by tonight and Young and teammate Will Mallory are just as safe as anyone on the slate in this price range.

Other Wide Receivers To Consider:

Ryan O’Keefe - Central Florida ($6.4K DK/$8.1K FD) A top DK cash play

Javon Baker - Central Florida ($6.1K DK/$7.0K FD) Top FD Cash play

Zay Flowers - Boston College ($8.7K FD)

Keylon Stokes - Tulsa ($7.5K DK Top GPP

Michael Mayer - Notre Dame ($6.2K DK/$7.5K FD)

Oronde Gadsden II - Syracuse ($7.7K FD)

Matthew Golden - Houston ($5.4K DK)

Marvin Mims - Oklahoma ($7.2K DK/$7.5K FD) FD GPP

Jordan Addison - USC ($7.8K DK/$9.5K FD)

Will Mallory - Miami (FL) ($3.5K DK/$5.5K FD)

Holden Willis - South Florida ($3.2K DK$4.8K FD)

Donovan Green - Texas A&M ($3.0K DK/$5.3K FD)
