Auburn’s first game of the post-Bryan Harsin era didn’t end with a victory, but it provided a sense of optimism around the program under the guidance of interim head coach Cadillac Williams.

Auburn fell to Mississippi State, 39-33, in overtime Saturday in Starkville, Miss. It was a heartbreaking result for the Tigers, who rallied from a 21-point first-half deficit to claim the lead twice in the final minutes of regulation. Ultimately, though, Auburn fell short thanks in large part to some special teams miscues.

What Mike Leach said about Mississippi State’s overtime win against Auburn

Rewinding Auburn’s 39-33 loss to Mississippi State

The Tigers’ losing streak now sits at five games, and Williams will have to wait a little longer for his first career win as a head coach. Though Auburn lost yet again, the program showed a renewed sense of resiliency under Williams -- a fresh start on a season gone awry. That much was evident after the game, when players spoke glowingly of their interim coach and reshuffled staff and, while expressing disappointment about the result, felt like they still came out on top at Davis Wade Stadium.
