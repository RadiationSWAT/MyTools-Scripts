Michigan’s football team used a dominant second half Saturday to beat Rutgers 52-17 and leave Piscataway, N.J. with a 9-0 record.

The Wolverines outscored the Scarlet Knights (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) 38-0 in the final 30 minutes as it bounced back after a sluggish start.

For Michigan’s performance, it received an overall grade of 84.1 from Pro Football Focus – its best mark since Week 6 against Indiana.

Per PFF, an average grade is about 64 out of 100.

It evaluates every player on every play in multiple facets of the game, such as passing, rushing, receiving, pass blocking, run defense, etc. PFF doesn’t base its grade on the outcome of the play, but rather what a player attempts to do on a given play.

For instance, if a receiver drops a pass that was on target, the quarterback would still receive a positive rating for the pass, while the receiver would get docked.

With that said, here are Michigan’s snap counts and key takeaways from PFF’s grades from Saturday’s victory.

Have yourself a day, Michael Barrett

The redshirt senior has had an OK season so far according to PFF metrics, but he shined Saturday. With Michigan missing several key pieces on defense, including linebacker Kalel Mullings, the team needed others to step up, and Barrett did. He by far had the best grade on the team at 91.8 and especially excelled in coverage – an area he has struggled this year. His 91.9 coverage grade isn’t surprising given he had two interceptions, including returning one for a touchdown. He was targeted five times and allowed two receptions for 1 yard.

Freshman cornerback Will Johnson makes the most of his opportunity

Starter Gemon Green was in uniform and participated in warmups but didn’t play, leading to Johnson making his first career. The former five-star recruit had a costly missed tackle in the first half but was stout in coverage and also had an interception. He allowed just one catch on six targets and had a 78.4 coverage grade – his highest of the season. His 78.2 overall mark also was his best of the year.

Michigan’s tight end depth

Michigan loves its two tight end sets, but it still is searching for a consistent complement to Luke Schoonmaker with Erick All out long term. The Wolverines played five other tight ends Saturday, including four who played more than 10 snaps, but true freshman Colston Loveland, redshirt freshman Matthew Hibner, walk-on Max Bredeson and graduate student Joel Honigford each received grades below 55.

Donovan Edwards continuing to blossom

Outside of receiver Ronnie Bell and Schoonmaker, Michigan’s pass-catchers have largely been inconsistent. Edwards continues to be involved in the passing game though and is becoming a go-to target for J.J. McCarthy. His route-running has been superb, and even his touchdown catch Saturday wasn’t an easy grab to make. Edwards garnered an overall mark of 90.2 and a whopping 94.6 pass game grade.
