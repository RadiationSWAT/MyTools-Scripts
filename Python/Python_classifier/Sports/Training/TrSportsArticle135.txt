Come on down, because it’s time to play The Price is Right.

The Washington Commanders announced last week owner Daniel Snyder is preparing to sell his team. And that has some of the deepest pockets and biggest names getting ready to toss around some serious Monopoly money.

The New York Post reports “the partnership of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and hip-hop mogul Jay-Z will put in an official joint bid to purchase the team in January, according to sources with knowledge of the situation.”

A rep for Bezos was unavailable for comment. Bezos and Jay-Z are longtime friends, and Jay-Z spent time aboard Bezos’ yacht in September.

ESPN reports one of the NBA’s biggest stars could look to join the bid by Bezos and Jay-Z. Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant, a lifelong Commanders fan, says he wants in.

“In a perfect world, I would be a part of it,” Durant told ESPN. “I would love to do it. I would love to give a little bit of my money to be a part of the Commanders, but we’ll see. Hopefully it’s somebody nice. I heard [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos and Jay-Z, but you never know.”

So how much will it cost to buy the Commanders? Per PFF’s Ari Meirov:

The asking price for the Washington Commanders is expected to go for about $7 billion (!!), according to @JayGlazer. The hope is for something to get done within the next six months. The #Broncos recently sold for a record $4.65 billion. Washington could go for way, way more.

ESPN reports Snyder bought the franchise for $800 million in 1999.
