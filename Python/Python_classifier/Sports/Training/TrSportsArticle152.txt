Eurosport tennis expert Mats Wilander is heavily impressed by Felix Auger-Aliassime's recent form as he feels the Canadian will now start competing with the best in the game such as Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Auger-Aliassime, 22, is having an outstanding indoor season as he captured three consecutive titles in Florence, Antwerp and Basel.

“It’s an unbelievable thing to win three in a row, it’s an amazing physical effort. These tournaments are tournaments where he’s basically beating players that he should beat, and we always knew Felix Auger-Aliassime had it in him to beat players that he’s better than," Wilander told Eurosport.

Earlier this year, Auger-Aliassime pushed Nadal into a five-setter at the French Open. At this past Laver Cup, Auger-Aliassime upset Djokovic. “On paper when he’s up against the best players in the world, that’s when he has to start believing he’s as good as them.

This is just a confidence boost, it couldn’t happen to a better and nicer guy," Wilander added.

Wilander suggests Auger-Aliassime could beat Djokovic again

Should Auger-Aliassime and Djokovic meet again, Wilander feels it would definitely be a tough matchup for the Serb.

“Be very aware, when he’s playing, his serve is absolutely huge, his physicality is that of Novak Djokovic and maybe even a step above, and that doesn't come lightly under my mouth because I’ve always thought Djokovic was the greatest athlete of any sport.

But Felix Auger-Aliassime is right up there and would push Novak for his money in every department physically, and that’s unbelievable," Wilander explained. Meanwhile, Auger-Aliassime has proved this year that he can win when it matters.

After losing his first eight finals, Auger-Aliassime has won four titles this year. To win three titles in as many weeks is quite a stat and Auger-Aliassime's big goal for the next season will certainly be to win his first Grand Slam
