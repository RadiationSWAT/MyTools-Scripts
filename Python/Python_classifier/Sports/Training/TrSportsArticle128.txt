The worst fears of those that thought Aidos Yerbossynuly took entirely too much punishment Saturday night during his 12th-round knockout loss to David Morrell Jr. have been confirmed.

According to a report published by BoxeoPlus.com, which cited an unnamed source, Yerbossynuly was in critical condition Sunday and placed in a medically induced coma. Kazakhstan’s Yerbossynuly, 30, was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis for immediate medical treatment after sustaining damage to his brain during his brutal loss.

Yerbossynuly began bleeding from his nose during the second round. Blood never stopped pouring from his nose for 10-plus rounds and Yerbossynuly courageously took an inordinate amount of punishment during his lopsided loss.

Morrell (8-0, 7 KOs) finally knocked the previously unbeaten Yerbossynuly to the canvas twice during the 12th round.

A straight left hand by Morrell dropped Yerbossynuly the first time. Yerbossynuly got up, but Morrell later him with two left hands and then a crushing right uppercut that knocked the challenger flat on his back.

Referee Tony Weeks stopped their 168-pound title fight following that second knockdown, but with only 26 seconds remaining in the 12-round bout. Morrell helped walk a battered, bloodied Yerbossynuly back to his corner after their fight was stopped.

Ronnie Shields, Morrell’s trainer, told BoxingScene.com late Saturday night that he felt their bout should’ve been halted as early as the eighth round. Shields suspected that Yerbossynuly took too many flush punches and questioned why Weeks or those that worked Yerbossynuly’s corner didn’t stop their bout before the Cuban southpaw viciously knocked him out.

Yerbossynuly (16-1, 11 KOs), who was way behind on the scorecards when he was knocked out, was the mandatory challenger for Morrell’s WBA world super middleweight title. Showtime televised Morrell-Yerbossynuly as the main event of a three-bout broadcast from The Armory.
