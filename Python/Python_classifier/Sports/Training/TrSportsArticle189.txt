“As playoff and Heisman contenders ahead of them stumbled, it was a good day for the Ducks.” (AP)

“Oregon is quite clearly not the team that lost by 46 points to Georgia. The Ducks continue to fly together up the standings in the race for the Pac-12 title (remember, no divisions this year) and they certainly have a Playoff candidacy they’re putting together as well.” (SI)
