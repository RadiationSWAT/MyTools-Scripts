The Miami Dolphins held off the Chicago Bears, 35-32, despite Justin Fields setting an NFL single-regular-season game record in a breakout performance from the sophomore quarterback.

Fields broke Michael Vick’s single-regular-season game record with 178 rushing yards in the close loss. Only Colin Kaepernick had more in 2012 for the San Francisco 49ers – but that mark came in the NFC Divisional Round against the Green Bay Packers.

The huge game was negated by the high-flying Dolphins offense.

Tua Tagovailoa was 21 for 30 with 302 passing yards and three touchdowns. He averaged 10 yards per pass. Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and Jeff Wilson Jr. each had a touchdown catch. Hill finished with seven catches for 143 yards. Waddle had five catches for 5 yards and Wilson had three catches for 21 yards.
