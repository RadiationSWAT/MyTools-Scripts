The Brooklyn Nets are reportedly having second thoughts about hiring suspended Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka. League sources indicate that "strong voices" are encouraging Tsai to back off hiring Udoka to fill the Nets head coach vacancy, given the other challenges the franchise is currently facing.

Brooklyn was reportedly set to replace the recently fired Steve Nash with Udoka, but that hiring has not come to fruition despite being reported on several days ago. The Nets currently have Jacque Vaughn coaching the team in an interim capacity.

Brooklyn is in the midst of a suspension for point guard Kyrie Irving. Irving was suspended after sharing the link to an anti-Semitic film and failing to aplogize for that action. The Nets have outlined several steps Irving must complete before he will be allowed to return to the team.

Udoka is serving a year-long suspension from the Celtics for an inappropriate relationship with a Boston staffer. It was reported that the Celtics would not keep Udoka from taking another job, nor would Boston seek compensation for allowing Udoka out of his contract.
