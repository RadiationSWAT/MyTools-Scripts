LSU coach Brian Kelly expressed pride following Saturday's triumphant overtime win over Alabama. It was a 32-31 victory, decided on Jayden Daniels' two-point conversion toss toward the pylon to Mason Taylor that sent Tiger Stadium into a frenzy. LSU took control of the SEC West and looks to become the first two-loss team to reach the College Football Playoff if this season ends with a conference title.

Daniels gave LSU the lead late in the fourth quarter on a seven-yard touchdown pass to Taylor, but Alabama's Bryce Young led a game-tying drive that closed on Will Reichard's 46-yard field goal with 21 seconds left to force the extra session.

"Pretty excited locker room in there as you can imagine. I’m so proud of my football team and the way they just took it one play at a time," Kelly said. "For me, just to see them grow, this was the next stage of development of our football team in that they did not needed to just not think about outcome and think about one play at a time."
