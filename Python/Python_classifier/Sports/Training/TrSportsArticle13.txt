Weezy has seen enough.

Rapper Lil Wayne, who is a Green Bay Packers superfan, wrote the team’s 2022 obituary after their latest loss on Sunday – a 15-6 defeat to the Detroit Lions. Wayne tweeted the season was ultimately over and the organization should’ve gotten rid of Aaron Rodgers at the start of the season.

"RIP to the season we should’ve gotten rid of 12 before the season," he wrote.

Wayne’s love for the Packers came to a fever pitch during their Super Bowl run in the 2010 season. He released the song "Green & Yellow" as the team was getting ready to play the Pittsburgh Steelers for the Vince Lombardi Trophy. At the time, Wiz Khalifa’s "Black and Yellow" was a mega-hit and a rally cry for the city of Pittsburgh.

Wayne explained in January how he became a Packers fan. He said his dad attended Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans and came home with Packers memorabilia. The Packers beat the New England Patriots behind Brett Favre and Desmond Howard.

"When you from the hood, towels and all that s--- doesn't get hung up, nailed to walls. That gets used. So every day I was actually using the Green Bay towel, drinking out of that Green Bay cup, eating out of that Green Bay bowl," he said.

Rodgers had three interceptions and a touchdown pass in the loss. Green Bay has lost five in a row as the team continues to struggle.
