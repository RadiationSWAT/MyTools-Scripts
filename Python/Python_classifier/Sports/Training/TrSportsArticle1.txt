After offsetting penalties nixed the first attempt which initially saw Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman get decked, Titans safety Joshua Kalu lined up against Travis Kelce near the goal line.

Kelce met Kalu with both arms extended and it appeared at first they were holding each other. Kelce broke free with Kalu still trailing behind. Kalu appeared to get pushed in the facemask and lost his helmet on the play.

A penalty flag was thrown in the end zone and the defender was called for holding. Some fans argued there should’ve been a penalty on Kelce during the play.

Regardless, the Chiefs got another try and Mahomes scrambled into the end zone to complete the attempt. He appeared to headbutt the wall, reminiscent of Gus Frerotte. Luckily, Mahomes was OK.

The game was tied 17-17 with a little over 2 minutes remaining in regulation.
