The Carolina Hurricanes are looking to pick up their fifth win in a row as they host the Toronto Maple Leafs Sunday evening.

Carolina Hurricanes (8-2-1) vs. Toronto Maple Leafs (6-4-2) 2022-23 Regular Season — Game 12 Sunday, November 6, 2022 — 5pm ET PNC Arena — Raleigh, NC Watch: ESPN Listen: 99.9 The Fan SBN Opposition: Pension Plan Puppets Follow Canes Country on Social Media Twitter @CanesCountry Facebook Canes Country Instagram @canescountrypix

The Canes handled the Buffalo Sabres Friday night thanks in part to a hat trick by Sebastian Aho and strong play from the entire top-six. Carolina will be hoping to continue riding their hot hands heading into their match.

The Toronto Maple Leafs have struggled early on in the season, but are coming off of a big 2-1 win over the Boston Bruins Saturday night, being just the second team to best the B’s this season.

However, the biggest issue for Toronto is the injuries to their goaltenders and so Carolina will be facing third stringer Erik Kallgren in net with Keith Petruzzelli, who just today signed an NHL deal, backing him up.

Goaltending hasn’t been the Canes’ strength either as Frederik Andersen will get the start, rocking a 0.894 save percentage as compared to Kallgren’s 0.884.

It could be quite a high-scoring event before the night is done.
