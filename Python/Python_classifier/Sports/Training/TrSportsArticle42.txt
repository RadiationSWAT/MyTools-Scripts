The NFL season is simply flying by, and with a whopping six teams on bye in Week 9, NFL inactives are all the more important. With both the NFL and fantasy football seasons reaching a crucial point, fans and fantasy managers alike will be keenly looking out to see who is ruled in and out this week.

NFL Inactives for Week 9

With each NFL team able to dress up to 48 players for game day, they have to name any players above that among their inactives. Most NFL teams have between 53 and 55 players on their roster on a given week, meaning they usually list around five to seven players as inactives in any given week.
