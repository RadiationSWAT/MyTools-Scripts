Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will officially release on November 18th, and it appears that it will be playable on PC on day-1. Last week, the game was leaked online and from the looks of it, the Nintendo Switch emulator, Ryujinx, can run it.

As we can see, emulation is not perfect yet as there are a number of graphical glitches and performance issues. Still, we’re talking about an unreleased triple-A game. Thus, it’s quite impressive that the game can already run on this Nintendo Switch emulator.

YouTube’s ‘Lucas Reis’ has shared the following video, packing 2 hours of gameplay footage from it. In order to capture this footage, the YouTuber used an AMD Ryzen 5600g with 16GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3050.

As always, we won’t be allowing links to the actual ROM.

You can download the latest version of Ryujinx from here.

Enjoy!
