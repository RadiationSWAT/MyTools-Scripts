Sonic Frontiers is finally out now on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S (along with a bunch of other platforms), and it's been getting some fairly good reviews so far - although the Series S version has suffered quite a few complaints.

Basically, a lot of Series S owners have been discovering that Sonic Frontiers appears locked to 30FPS on the console, which seems strange considering Sonic Frontiers is designed to be focused around fast and smooth gameplay.

Here's what one owner had to say about the problem on Reddit earlier this week:

"Just started playing my pre-order and I'm still in shock. A fast-paced Sonic game on a current gen console... at 30fps? Also, yes, I searched the menu for a performance mode, but nothing. You would think maybe they could patch in a 60fps mode, but considering the large amounts of environmental pop-in I saw on my first playthrough? I'm not too optimistic..."

Following multiple reports of this, TheGamer reached out to SEGA for a response, and was provided with a workaround which involves going into the main settings of your Xbox and changing the display to 1080p rather than 4K.

Apparently, doing this should allow Sonic Frontiers to run at 60FPS, although obviously it's not an ideal solution in the long-term, and hopefully SEGA will patch the game to run at 60FPS regardless of your console's display settings.

In another separate message this week, Sonic Social Media Manager Katie Chrzanowski confirmed that the development team was still looking into the problem:
