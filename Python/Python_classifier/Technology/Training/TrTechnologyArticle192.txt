The name Daigo Umehara is one of the very few in the scene widely recognized outside of the fighting game community, and his competitive resume over the past 20+ years and multiple eras certainly speaks for itself.

Fighting game content creator and analyst HiFight recently released a great new entry into his Just Frame Breakdown series, which takes a closer look at BST|Daigo's difficult comeback against RB|Gachikun in Street Fighter 5.

The breakdown actually begins delving into the strong start of Gachikun where he was able to push Daigo's Guile to the corner and stun him with an excellent whiff punish.

When Guile's theme kicks in, however, you know things are about to get good.

Daigo catches Rashid's approach and immediately pops V-Trigger to use 5 mini Sonic Booms and his V-Skill air Sonic Boom, pushing Gachikun almost to the other corner in seconds.

The multi-game champion uses the last of his V-Trigger to sneak in and get 1 more throw before going the extra mile to close things out in a way that doesn't look possible.

Umehara lands a meaty standing light kick into Sonic Boom and then links into Flash Kick and Critical Art with HiFight showcasing how perfect your charges need to be to pull that off — especially in the middle of a match.

We highly recommend checking out HiFight's latest Just Frame Breakdown see what perfect play looks like in SF5.
