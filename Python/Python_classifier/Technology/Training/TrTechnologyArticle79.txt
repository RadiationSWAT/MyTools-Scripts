D3 Publisher and developer Shade have released a new trailer for sword-fighting action game SAMURAI MAIDEN introducing playable character Hagane (voiced by Sumire Uesaka).

Her character description reads: “Not only can her right arm extend and contract at will, but it can also emit a high-voltage current. Supportive and nurturing to the women around her, she heaps affection on them while paying no mind to their blushing.”

The previous character trailer introduced Iyo.

SAMURAI MAIDEN is due out for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch on December 1 in Japan, and for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam on December 8 worldwide.
