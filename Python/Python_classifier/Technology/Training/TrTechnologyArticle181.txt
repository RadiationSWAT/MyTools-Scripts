Apple finally removed the unloved Touch Bar from the MacBook Pro (2021) and instead added a complete set of physical function keys that include keyboard shortcuts have replaced the OLED strip on the top row of the keyboard. To the right, you'll still find a Touch ID button. It's much bigger than those on previous models. The Touch ID is entirely black with no backlighting, and it also serves as a power button.

Beyond the new function key row and redesigned Touch ID, the rest of the MacBook Pro's Magic keyboard is similar to those found on more recent models. These keyboards finally did away with the controversial butterfly mechanism and now use a scissor-switch arrangement. The resulting input feels solid and natural, as it should be on a laptop.
