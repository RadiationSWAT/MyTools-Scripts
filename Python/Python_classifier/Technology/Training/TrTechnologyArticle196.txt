How much do you know about PlayStation and the gaming industry that surrounds it? If you fancy yourself a walking PlayStation encyclopaedia, then why not put your brain to the test with our PlayStation General Knowledge Quiz?

But of course, this is not one of our ordinary PlayStation quizzes. With the release of God of War Ragnarok just around the corner (at the time of writing, at least!), we wanted to do a special issue on Sony's iconic series.

(And if you want to check out all of our previous PlayStation General Knowledge Quizzes, you can find them by clicking this link.)

Below, you'll find 15 God of War-related questions with multiple choice answers. Some are relatively easy, and others are devilishly difficult.

Good luck — you might need it!
