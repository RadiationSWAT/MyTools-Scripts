Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live are currently on sale for $99 (opens in new tab), which is a $70 price drop for the wireless earbuds. That's a nice pair of earbuds to pick up for less than $100. Our Galaxy Buds Live review praised Samsung's earbuds for their great sound quality and comfortable design. They also deliver pretty solid battery life, lasting nearly two straight days of heavy use in our testing.

And not just any midrange phones, but some of the best cheap phones available. Take the Galaxy A53, one of our favorite phones from the past year. Best Buy is offering the Galaxy A53 at $200 off the $449 phone (opens in new tab) when you activate the device with a phone carrier. If you get the phone unlocked, you can save $100 off the regular price. In our Galaxy A53 review, we like the phone's 120Hz display along with its strong build quality. The cameras are also good for a midrange model, too.

The deal is only for the 46mm variant and while it is not down to the lowest price we have seen for this watch, it still amounts to a huge $100 saving. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, LTE version is down to $329 at Amazon (opens in new tab). This is a big drop from its original price of $429. The watch has a sporty aesthetic, plus a cool body composition analysis feature, and revamped Wear OS software. In our Galaxy Watch 4 review (opens in new tab), we named it Samsung's best smartwatch ever. It also has an ECG sensor, GPS fall detection and can recognise upto 6 exercises automatically, for fitness enthusiasts. Overall, it is a good all-rounder watch and if you are looking at one without breaking the bank, this is a good option to consider.

(Image credit: Bose) Bose QuietComfort 45: $329 $249 @ Amazon For a limited time, the Bose QuietComfort 45 Wireless Headphones are on sale for $249 at Amazon. That’s $80 off the full retail price of $329 for a total savings of almost 25%. This deal brings the ANC headphones back down to their lowest-ever price. Note that this same discounted price is currently available at Best Buy. We rank the Bose QuietComfort 45 as some of the best headphones you can buy. In our Bose QuietComfort 45 review we labeled the slick headphones a “no-brainer for Bose fans who want to swap out their older QC headphones for something more modern, or shoppers who want first-class Bose noise cancellation for a cheaper price than the 700." In our testing we were most impressed by the high-end active nosing canceling. QuietComfort 45 also packs the excellent sound quality that you'd expect from a Bose product. And these are rated for a strong 24 hours of battery life with ANC enabled.

(Image credit: Sony/Future) Sony Bravia XR A80K 65-inch OLED TV: $2,299 $1,698 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) One of the latest OLED TVs by Sony is on sale that brings it down to a pretty affordable price. This is the Sony Bravia XR A80K 65-inch OLED TV and while it doesn't hold the top spot in our best OLED TVs list, it does bring some new features like a cognitive XR processor which delivers natural colors and special settings for gamers for the PlayStation 5. This TV is now on sale for $1,698 at Amazon (opens in new tab) which is the lowest price that it has ever dropped to. OLED TVs offer incredible picture quality — each pixel on the screen of an OLED TV is lit and colored individually, and there's no backlight behind the screen. That means richer colors and deeper blacks. Gadgets are already starting to see record low prices in early Black Friday deals this time, so if you are on the fence about upgrading your TV, this is a sweet deal to consider.

No, not with that long-lost uncle who doesn't hesitate to gas on about what he saw on cable news the other night — we're talking better home connectivity, and a good mesh router can help you achieve that with your Wi-Fi network. TP-Link's Deco X20 mesh router is that good router, and right now, it's on sale at Amazon. You can get a 3-pack of the Deco X20 mesh router for $179 (opens in new tab) — $70 off the regular $249 price. (If you don't need the 5,800-square feet of coverage the 3-pack provides, Amazon is also discounting the 2-pack Deco X20 package.) In our Deco X20 review, we were impressed by the excellent range and added security features. It's also an inexpensive way to get Wi-Fi 6 into your home, especially with this Amazon price cut.

It's kitted out with Fitbit's Activity Zone Minutes, sleep tracking, stress management tools, and provides a 5-day battery life. Even better, you can snag one for $50 off right now at Best Buy.

Although we haven't reviewed this specific model, we have reviewed other G15 configs and have generally found them to be reliable/affordable gaming laptops. Heads up that the Dell website says this laptop deal is 69% claimed, which means it could sell out fast.

(Image credit: Nectar ) Nectar Duvet (queen): $179 $120 @ Nectar (opens in new tab) There are a lot of great deals today, but for non-tech items — this might be my favorite. Nectar is taking 33% off sitewide right now. The sale includes the excellent Nectar duvet. I love my Nectar duvet. I bought it a few years ago and since then have purchased a second one. It's super-soft and made of breathable cotton that keeps you warm during the winter and cool during the summer. The duvet also holds a spot in our list of the best duvets. Right now you can get the twin for $100 (was $149) or the queen for $120 (was $179).

(Image credit: Future) Sony WH-1000XM4: $348 $228 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) They're no longer Sony's flagship 'phones, but the WH-1000XM4 are still among the best headphones you can buy. In our Sony WH-1000XM4 review, we described the headphones as "Sony's best pair of noise-cancelling headphones yet" and called them "a fine-tuned enhancement that stands out as the best in the series, and even beats the best-in-class Bose 700 in some key areas." We especially loved the excellent audio, remarkable noise cancellation, intuitive smart controls, and the superb battery life of around 30 hours (with Active Noise Cancellation enabled). They're not at their lowest price ever.

Otherwise, you get the same hardware as its predecessor.

(Image credit: Best Buy) Gigabyte G5 gaming laptop: $999 $549 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) Gaming laptops are usually a pretty pricey investment, but thanks to Black Friday deals you can get a machine sporting solid specs for less than you might expect. Case in point, this Gigabyte G5 gaming laptop is on sale for $549 at Best Buy (opens in new tab) — that's a saving of $350 compared to its regular retail price of $999. At this price, don't expect a cutting-edge laptop, but it does packs a 15.6-inch Full HD screen, an Intel Core i5-11400H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. The laptop also sports a 144Hz refresh rate, which is a really nice bonus, and makes it a great pick for playing fast-paced shooters or action games. The G5's specs are from 2021 but they still hold up extremely well. Granted, the 512GB of storage is a little on the small size (but one of the best external hard drives will fix that) but otherwise this is reasonably powerful gaming laptop at an entry-level price.
