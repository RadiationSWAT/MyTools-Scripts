The LEGO Ideas platform is no longer accepting submissions for The Legend of Zelda projects due to a “license conflict”.

While Nintendo and LEGO have worked directly over the past few years – primarily when it comes to Mario – we’ve yet to really see anything come to fruition when it comes to LEGO Ideas. This system lets fans send over ideas that could turn into official products down the line.

Regarding Zelda, there have been at least eight fan designs that have reached 10,000 votes on LEGO Ideas and have made it to the review stage. Unfortunately though, none have progressed beyond that point. All of the projects were rejected. And going forward, all submissions based on Zelda will no longer be accepted.

Some might be wondering what the reasoning is here, but we unfortunately don’t have any concrete information. One possibility is that Nintendo and LEGO teaming up for their own Zelda sets, but Brick Fanatics speculates that a rival manufacturer has acquired the rights to produce construction toys based on the franchise. The site mentions that those attempting to submit a Zelda idea to LEGO Ideas are informed that the IP has been evaluated, and “determined that we can’t allow submissions” because of the aforementioned “license conflict”. The same reason is given for IPs like Pokemon, which currently has a partnership with Mega Construx.

Other Nintendo-related projects can still be submitted to LEGO Ideas. Zelda was naturally a popular choice, but fans will have to opt for a different IP in the future.
