The LG C2 OLED 55-inch has crashed to $1,296 on Amazon (opens in new tab), which is about $500 off one of the best TVs we've ever tested.

Top-tier performance, plenty of port options and great gaming features all come together in a sleek package. When watching Top Gun: Maverick, "we were blown away with the motion handling of the speeding fighter jets." The LG C2 OLED TV’s internal speakers are also upgraded from 5.1.2 channel to 7.1.2 channel sound, complete with Dolby Atmos support and an AI sound feature that creates a more immersive soundscape.

This technology closes the gap in quality between LED and OLED, offering higher levels of detail and contrast than LED TVs normally allow. This 2022 LG QNED TV has been discounted by a whopping $700, making it cheaper than most OLED TVs of its size.

It has one HDMI 2.1 port and three HDMI 2.0 ports, a refresh rate of 120Hz, and an AI-based processor to enhance both image and audio from the set.

This novel concept takes a traditional television and makes it instead look more like a picture frame. It has an innovative design that looks like a work of art and when you’re not using the Samsung Frame to watch TV shows and movies, it can be set to display family photos or famous artwork.

(Image credit: Hisense) Hisense 55" U8H Mini-LED Smart TV: was $1,149 now $599 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) All week, I've been getting questions from readers about my Hisense U8H review and whether or not they should pick one up before Black Friday. As much as I liked Hisense's Mini-LED TV, having given it a 4-star rating, I’ve been on the fence about a recommendation given how many other TV deals there are this week. But then I saw that the Hisense U8H had dropped in price and is now available for $599 at Amazon (opens in new tab) for Black Friday. In my review of the Hisense U8H, I heaped praise on the TV for its excellent brightness and contrast due to the use of its Mini-LED backlight. On top of those specs advantages, the Hisense U8H supports Dolby Vision IQ and Dolby Atmos and rocks two 10W speakers and a 20W woofer for ultimate TV sound. For gamers, the Hisense U8H supports auto-low latency mode and 120Hz VRR. Just watch out: Two of its ports will support 4K@120Hz, while the other two only support 4K@60Hz. Having all four of them be full-spec HDMI 2.1 would’ve been great, but two are better than none. The cherry on top of this TV? The Hisense U8H has an ATSC 3.0 tuner that will enable it to watch NextGen TV over-the-air broadcasts. Not every broadcaster has adopted the new standard, but anyone with a Hisense U8H will be ready for them as they roll out across the country.

(Image credit: Samsung) Samsung Q80B 50" QLED 4K TV: was $997 now $779 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) Speaking of QLED TVs, there's an excellent deal going on for Samsung's mid-range Q80B QLED TV that one of our staffers picked up a few weeks ago. "I bought this TV back in October after my old TV broke," says our How To Editor, Peter Wolinski. "I have to admit, I didn't know much about the Q80B or Samsung TVs in general, and just wanted a 50" QLED for a reasonable price, with respectable sound and from a reputable brand (given my old TV's panel broke itself). Boy, did I accidentally pick the perfect TV for me. "The Samsung Q80B's 4K QLED panel really is beautiful. It offers great contrast and rich, deep colors thanks to Samsung's Quantum XDR technology. It's bright enough that I've had no trouble watching in daylight with the TV placed next to a window, too. I can also vouch for the viewing angles, as we have a pretty odd set up in our lounge thanks to a large dog crate. The image remains accurate even at wide angles." If you want a great 50-inch model – potentially one of the best available right now – then check out the Q80B that's down to just $779 @ Amazon.

(Image credit: Samsung) Samsung 65" S95B OLED 4K Smart TV: was $2,997 now $1,797 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) You know that OLED TVs are great, but did you know that there's a better TV technology that just came out this year? It's called QD-OLED, and it blends the quantum dots of Samsung's QLED TVs with an OLED panel. When it launched, Samsung's first QD-OLED sold for close to $3,000 but, for a limited time, the 65-inch Samsung S95B OLED 4K Smart TV is on sale for $1,797 at Amazon (opens in new tab). That’s a massive $1,200 off its full list price of $2,997. In our Samsung S95B OLED TV review, we said “The innovative Samsung S95B combines Samsung’s consumer electronics know-how with the best aspects of both OLED and quantum dot technology.” We praised its superb picture quality — even if its blacks are imperfect — and also loved its gaming credentials with a seriously low input lag of just 9.2ms making it pair perfectly with next-gen consoles.

(Image credit: Future) TCL 98" QLED 4K TV: was $8,499 now $4,999 @ Best Buy (opens in new tab) 75-inch and 85-inch TVs are pretty massive, but there's one TV on sale today that's bigger than all the rest. Right now the TCL 98" XL Collection 4K QLED TV is on sale for $4,999 at Best Buy. I know that's still a good chunk of change, but the massive set normally costs $8,499. That means this Black Friday TV deal takes $3,500 off regular price, making this one of the most significant savings opportunities we've seen for Black Friday yet.

(Image credit: Amazon) Sony 65" X80K LED Smart TV: $999 $698 @ Amazon (opens in new tab) When I'm asked for recommendations for an affordable mid-range TV, I typically recommend either TCL or Sony. The TCL 6-Series holds a spot in my heart as one of the best value TVs, but Sony's X80 Series is a close second. Equipped with the X1 Processor and TRILUMINOS Pro display, the X80K should deliver a bright, colorful and clear picture that puts older models to shame. With close to 600 reviews and a 4.5 rating, this 2022 model has the mettle to stand up to other great mid-rangers like the TCL 6-Series and Vizio M-Series Quantum, but comes with Google TV built-in to help it stand apart from the competition. If you're in the market for a new 2022 mid-range model, the Sony X80K is a great option.

This 55-inch set delivers a sharp 4K picture with support for HDR 10, HLG and Dolby Digital Plus. The Fire TV 4 Series makes it easy to launch your favorite streaming services, and you get an Alexa Voice Remote to find find apps, movies and shows. You also get 3 HDMI ports along with HDMI eARC support. Not bad at all for under $300 for Black Friday.
