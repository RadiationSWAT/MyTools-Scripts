Black Friday Alienware gaming laptop deals

Some of the best Black Friday gaming laptop deals, period, are right here. Alienware's laptops have a good range of options, whether you're eyeing a 30-series GPU or an AMD configuration.

(opens in new tab) Alienware x14 | Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti | Intel Core i7 12700H | 14-inch | 1080p | 144Hz | 16GB RAM | 512 SSD| $1,699.99 $1,199.99 at Dell (save $500) (opens in new tab)

In our review (opens in new tab), the biggest thing holding back this laptop was the price. Its bright display, stylish design, and great gaming performance make it a better pick at this discounted price. This one has a 3050 Ti and a powerful CPU, so it should handle everything shy of triple-A games at high settings.

(opens in new tab) Alienware M15 R7 | Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti | AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX | 15.6-inch | 1080p | 165Hz | 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD | $1,849.99 $1,299.99 at Dell (save $550) (opens in new tab)

A very nice machine here, with a powerful CPU/GPU combo that will eat through those frames at the native 1080p. That's a powerful CPU backing up a great last gen mobile GPU and it even comes topped with some tasty DDR5-4800 RAM. It's a little lacking on the storage side, but it could be worse, for sure.

(opens in new tab) Alienware m15 Ryzen Edition | Nvidia RTX 3070 | AMD Ryzen 5900HX | 15.6-inch | 1080p | 360Hz | 16GB RAM | 1TB SSD| $2,449.99 $1,499.99 at Dell (save $950) (opens in new tab)

This laptop is packed with powerful hardware. Its RTX 3070 and Ryzen 9 5900HX processor will tear through a ton of games at 1080p. And the 1TB SSD is a nice addition that you don't see enough in deals like this.

(opens in new tab) Alienware m17 R5| Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti | AMD Ryzen 7 6800H | 17.3-inch | 1080p | 360Hz | 16GB RAM | 1TB SSD| $2,149.99 $1,699.99 at Dell (save $450) (opens in new tab)

The Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti and Ryzen 7 6800H give this Alienware laptop a ton of power for modern games. Its 360Hz screen means it's a good pick if you play competitive games that benefit from high refresh rates. The 16GB of 4800MHz DDR5 RAM will help handle a lot of other tasks too.

(opens in new tab) Alienware x17 | Nvidia RTX 3080 | Intel Core i9 12900H | 17.3-inch | 4k | 120Hz | 32GB RAM | 1TB SSD| $3,579.99 $2,899.99 at Dell (save $680) (opens in new tab)

This Alienware is still fairly pricey with the discount. You're paying for the Nvidia RTX 3080, i9 12900H, and the 4K screen—all of which will make games look great, but will come with a huge cost to battery life. If you want what is essentially a desktop replacement laptop, consider this one.

Black Friday Alienware gaming PC deals

Don't let the looks deceive you here, Alienware's gaming PC deals are solid. It has AMD- and Intel-powered rigs paired with nice graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia. Some of their builds could use larger SSDs, but if that doesn't bother you, these deals are worth sifting through.

(opens in new tab) Alienware Aurora R13 | AMD RX 6700 XT | Intel Core i7 12700F | 16GB DDR5 RAM | 512GB SSD | $1,949.99 $1,199.99 at Dell (Save $750) (opens in new tab)

I don't think I've ever seen a machine with an RX 6700 XT in it for this price. The 512GB SSD is a little on the small side, but there's 16GB of speedy DDR5-4400 dual-channel RAM backing up a great GPU and a fantastic high-end CPU. There's not a lot to be concerned about here, especially with a discount like that.

(opens in new tab) Alienware Aurora R10 | AMD RX 6800 XT | AMD Ryzen 7 5800 | 16GB RAM | 1TB SSD + 1TB HDD| $1,849.99 $1,249.99 at Best Buy (save $600) (opens in new tab)

Alienware and affordability don't always see eye to eye. But a Radeon RX 6800 XT plus Ryzen 7 5800 for $1,249 is a great deal for any PC, let alone one with Alienware's signature megabucks design vibe. Extras include 16GB of RAM and both a 1TB SSD and 1TB HDD. The Alienware usual caveats apply re possible future difficulties upgrading major items like the motherboard. But as a turn-key solution, this is very appealing.

(opens in new tab) Alienware Aurora R14 | AMD RX 6800 XT | Ryzen 7 5800X | 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD + 1TB HDD | $2,399.99 $1,799.99 at Dell (save $600) (opens in new tab)

It's worth remembering just what a fantastic graphics card the RX 6800 XT is. It's at the same level as the RTX 3080 outside of ray tracing, and generally comes in a lot cheaper. That means this Alienware machine is less expensive than an equivalent Nvidia-powered version, and still comes with 16GB RAM. That 512GB SSD is a bit miserly though, even if it comes with some slow data storage as a backup.

(opens in new tab) Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R14 | AMD RX 6600 XT | Ryzen 7 5800 | 16GB RAM | 512GB | $1,729.99 $1,299.99 at Dell (save $600) (opens in new tab)

This Ryzen version of Alienware's R14 gaming PC comes with a 6600 XT and a Ryzen 7 5800. It's a nice package that few games will hold back at 1440p. The 512GB SSD is disappointing to see at this price point, but it's something you can upgrade if you need to.

(opens in new tab) Alienware Aurora R13 | Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti | Intel Core i9 12900F | 32GB RAM | 1TB SSD| $3,199.99 $2,499.99 at Dell (save $700) (opens in new tab)

This Alienware gaming PC sits on the higher end of the options available. The price has been cut down a bit, but the i9 12900F and RTX 3080 Ti will still cost you. This PC is made for pushing 4k or 1440p at high frame rates.

(opens in new tab) Alienware Aurora R13 | Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti | Intel Core i7 12700F | 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD| $1,871.99 $1,299.99 at Dell (save $572) (opens in new tab)

You can save around $500 on this Alienware gaming PC that comes with a RTX 3060 Ti and an i7 12700F. The RAM and SSD aren't quite what we'd like to see in a build at this price, but you can always upgrade those down the line.

Black Friday Alienware gaming keyboards

I didn't expect Alienware to have Black Friday deals on low profile keyboards, but here we are. You can pick up a mechanical keyboard with short-distance keys in either black or white. The price drop isn't steep, but they are by no means bad deals.
