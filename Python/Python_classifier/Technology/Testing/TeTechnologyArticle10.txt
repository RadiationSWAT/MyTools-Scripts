Whether it be the new Surface Laptop 5, the latest Dell XPS, or something a little bit whacky like the ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo, it's all on sale this week, and we've rounded it up in one convenient list for you.

(opens in new tab) Surface Laptop 5 | $ 1,299 $999 at Amazon (opens in new tab) The Surface Laptop 5 only just came out, as in, within the last few weeks, so it's crazy to see it on sale with such a steep discount already. You can grab $300 off the Surface Laptop 5, and either 13.5-inch or 15-inch variants, with the entry-level SKU coming in at just $999 with the discount in place.

Surface Laptop 5 is one of the best all-rounder laptops on the market. Available in two sizes: 13.5 and 15-inches, and can be had in four great colorways including Platinum, Black, Forest, and Sandstone. It has a large, quiet trackpad, tactile yet quiet keyboard, and a slim design that's modern and clean.

(opens in new tab) Dell XPS 13 $999 $750 at Dell (opens in new tab) The NEW Dell XPS 13 features Intel's latest 12th-generation Intel processors, in both i5 or i7 configurations, up to 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD storage.

The Dell XPS 13 line is tried and tested, and has been a pinnacle in design for the Windows PC space for almost a decade. It's the line that's constantly pushing the boundaries of what an "edge to edge" display can truly be, while also packing as much power as possible into the smallest package.

(opens in new tab) ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo 15 $2,299 $1,849 at Amazon (opens in new tab) This is a one of a kind laptop, featuring not one, but TWO displays. There's a large 15.6-inch 4K OLED touchscreen at the top, and a secondary 14-inch touchscreen that sits above your keyboard. Both screens work together as one continuous display, or two separate ones for multiple apps. It's also super powerful, with an Intel Core i7 12800H and NVIDIA RTX 3060 on the inside.

Looking for something a little out of the ordinary? How about a laptop that has two displays? The ZenBook Pro Duo has a secondard 14-inch touchscreen display above the keyboard, while also moving the trackpad to the right-hand side of the keyboard deck. It's a weird combination, but one that works surprisingly well.

ASUS has a similar product on sale this weekend, but featuring a nicer 16:10 aspect ratio display, which is a little taller than what you can find on most other laptops.
