There are Black Friday savings to be had across nearly the entire Apple product lineup. Discounts apply to both previous- and current-generation cyber icons: MacBooks, iPads, Apple Watches, AirPods and more.

So far, we’ve found some great Apple deals from Amazon — here’s what we’ve unearthed.

Apple AirTag 4 Pack

Buy here for $80 (originally $99).

Apple AirTags. APPLE

This year’s hottest travel accessory is, without a doubt, Apple’s AirTags. These coin-sized buttons help you track and find your most important items. With missing and delayed checked bags becoming a staple of the pandemic-era travel experience, it’s more important than ever to pop an AirTag into your checked bag.

You may even want to add one to your rollaboard, backpack and purse since you never know when you may end up gate-checking these items. As we’ve seen during this year’s travel meltdowns, pulling up your item’s current location without relying on an airline’s information is priceless. Here’s how you may be able to layer on some additional savings if you have an American Express credit card.

These earbuds are definitely powerful enough to be most travelers’ go-to.
