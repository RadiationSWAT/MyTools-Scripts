The QN900A uses mini LED backlighting to produce a very bright display which makes it suitable for use in well-lit environments. It uses full-array local dimming to produce deep blacks and it handles glare impressively. Its wide viewing angles preserve the accuracy of images whilst being viewed from the side and images don’t look too washed out at close proximity. Its low response time, low input lag, and support of FreeSync to reduce screen tearing make it suitable for gaming.

The TV itself is incredibly elegant with edge-to-edge viewing on its infinity screen and ultra-slim build. It also supports all the features that you would expect from a smart TV at its price point.
