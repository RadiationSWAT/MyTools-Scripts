You earned the MVP slot for holiday shopping this year—you had your lists made in October, pre-shopped all the early deals you could find and have a game plan for big savings this weekend. Put down the leftovers and take note: Walmart has slashed prices on tons of tech for Black Friday.

We've partnered with Walmart for their Deals for Days campaign to bring you the best ideas (and savings) leading up to the holiday season. From a low, low price on a new Roomba for pet parents to a huge smart TV that's amazing for streaming movies, we've highlighted the best sales to shop during the Superbowl of shopping that is Black Friday. Score!

TVs

Walmart Vizio 70" Class V-Series 4K UHD LED Smart TV We're moving into TV season—the weather is getting colder and the threat of snow has you hunkering down and making plans to stay indoors. Plus, all the sports, holiday movies and family togetherness means your current system is going to get a workout. If you're considering an update this 70-inch smart TV with built-in Chromecast is on a huge discount at under $500. According to this reviewer, this is the real deal: "This TV is awesome for the price. I did my research and there isn't anywhere that sells this item for the price I've gotten it on Black Friday. I have previously owned a Vizio so I did experience how reliable Vizio's are. I'm not only happy with the purchase, but the resolution is incredible. I've tried a variety of 4K and 8K youtube videos and programs and the images are very clean crisp and detailed, the sound is also very loud and clear. If you are upgrading from a 1080P I highly recommend this TV." $448 at Walmart

One reviewer called it a "wonderful holiday gift" adding, "If you are shopping for a robotic vacuum, run to grab this one! With the dry weather here, my floors looked dusty and dirty on a daily basis. After using this for the past 6 weeks, I can't believe the difference in our home! The best part is that the vacuum empties itself after each clean- no messy emptying in the garbage can. With its smart technology, the robot maps my house and avoids obstacles. I can easily control it from my phone, which is one of my favorite features. My floors have never looked cleaner and I am a HUGE fan!" $288 at Walmart
