Walmart's packed with Black Friday goodies — time to shop! (Photo: Walmart)

Walmart continues to drop stellar Black Friday sales — and most will sell out. So shop now, while the gettin' is good. Save over $300 on a Samsung 50-inch TV, which is somehow down to $459. Get a Shark wet-dry robovac for more than 50% off and score this cult-fave Vitamix blender for over $200 off. Thanks to a glut of overstock, you'll find amazing deals outside the usual categories. Kristen Gall, Retail and Shopping Expert for Rakuten, says “home goods, gardening and furniture" could yield super-savings. But with Walmart, the most important thing is to move fast. So get scrolling!

Holiday Decor

The tree's not real...but the hundreds of dollars you'll save over the years very much are. (Photo: Walmart)

A real tree can liven up the holiday, but it also brings needles — so, so many needles that even one of Walmart's many vacs will be hard at work cleaning up well after "Auld Lang Syne." (Which means you will, too.) But not to worry! There's Best Choice 4'5" Snow-Flocked Christmas Tree has all of the spirit and none of the mess. This tree features a simple three-step assembly, and the foldable stand and hinged sections make it easy to disassemble for storage — which means this will be a holiday staple for years.

Echoed another, "I grew up playing this game with my siblings and so being able to play this game with my children is an amazing experience."

Beautiful by Drew Barrymore

Made for everyday cooking with friends and family, the Beautiful 11" Stir Fry Pan has a deep, rounded design, providing ample space to sauté and stir-fry to perfection. It's impeccably crafted with die-cast, double-riveted gold handles. Dare we say it's beautiful? It's also dishwasher-safe and compatible with all stove tops, including induction. This foodie loved the pan's construction: "Love the color, and the pan is well made! A nice size for stir-frying or sautéing and has a heavier gauge bottom, so it won't warp. I like the handle and find it to be stylish and easy to store this pan. Nonstick and easy to clean after using, as well as versatile in its use!"

When is Black Friday?

Black Friday is on Friday, November 25. It's the day after Thanksgiving and is historically a great time to get next-level deals on a range of must-have items.

When do Black Friday deals end?

Some deals will end at midnight on Friday, November 25th, but many will stretch through the weekend to Cyber Monday.

Does Black Friday have deals on everything?

Not everything is on sale for Black Friday, but a lot is. You'll see impressive discounts on items such as air fryers, TVs, vacuums, furniture, sneakers, clothes, electric toothbrushes, makeup and so much more. If there's an item you've been waiting to go on sale, it's most likely to be marked down during Black Friday season.

Are we still at risk of supply chain delays?

Retailers have had a year to plan to avoid the massive delivery delays we saw last year, so shopping Black Friday should leave time for stuff to arrive before the holidays. But that's assuming no big surprises or snags.
