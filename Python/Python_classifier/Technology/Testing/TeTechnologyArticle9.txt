While it won't run new games at max settings, it's more than enough to play most games on medium-low. $499 at Walmart

One customer said, "Build quality excellent due to the metal construction (a bit heavy, but it is to be expected). Sound was good, as the Dolby Atmos helps with audio quality despite laptop speakers being small and downward-firing. The processor is snappy and handled multitasking like a champ. The Iris Xe Max graphics it's paired with are able to pull some decent weight in FPSs like Valorant/Apex and MOBAs."

"This is the first time I have a computer with a touchscreen, and I’m in love. This computer is on the smaller side and it’s very light, and along with the touchscreen it makes it very versatile. The battery lasts for about seven hours for me and charges back up very quickly (less than two hours per my estimate). The screen is HD and the speakers being on either side of the keyboard make a great video-watching experience," said one satisfied shopper. "The combination of having 16GB for RAM and having a decent processor also make this computer incredibly fast and allows you to do several things at the same time (like voice and video plus text messaging and having several other apps open). Definite recommend!"

Glossary of terms

Tech terms can be a little confusing to understand, but let us break it down for you.

Onboard storage/memory/SSD: These terms all refer to the amount of content a computer can hold. Games, documents, videos, pictures, and more all count toward this. It's what was once referred to as a hard drive, although most drives now are solid-state drives. 256GB is the standard, and usually the lowest you should go.

RAM: RAM is a type of temporary memory that the computer uses to keep things within easy reach. The more RAM it has, the better a computer performs. Between 8GB and 16GB of RAM is the average for modern computers, with gaming computers leaning toward the higher end.

Graphics card/GPU: This is the device that helps create images on-screen. These tend to be expensive additions, and the highest-end cards can cost upwards of $1,000 on their own. A laptop that includes an RTX 2000- or 3000-series card is offering tremendous value if it falls in an affordable price range.

CPU: This stands for "central processing unit." It describes how much a computer can do at once without slowing down. The more cores, the more data a system can handle.
